Additionally, as Amazon expands its delivery network, it faces the challenge of maintaining efficiency while managing environmental concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Opportunities:</strong> Amazon’s continued investment in AI, cloud computing, and logistics presents long-term growth potential. Expanding its presence in emerging markets and capitalizing on its advertising business offer further avenues for revenue diversification.
